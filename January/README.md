## Notes On Individual Problems

Here are some more in depth descriptions on issues that I ran into on some of these problems and specific scores.

All of these solutions are fixed post contest, but I have explanations of where I went wrong originally.

## THE PROBLEMS:

> My personal take: I messed up pretty bad... I got the algorithms to most of these problems completely correct, but because of a mixture of not noticing a couple details in problems, I missed the pass

`Majority Opinion`
- I didn't sort the output, but my algorithm is correct. So essentially, I missed the problem merely due to incorrect output formatting

`Cannonball`
- For this problem, I also had the correct algorithm, but I did one thing wrong... the way I handled the case of "infinity bounce" was incorrect, as it didn't account for there being targets between the "0" pads

`Pesticides`
- I didn't understand the sample case, so unfortunately I couldn't code it, but afterwards I have written a working solution though only for the first 10/15
